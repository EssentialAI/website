    <p class = 'content'>This book is written with the aim of consolidating reference material for Reinforcement Learning from multiple books and course videos. The topics of this book become progressively more complex and mathematically intensive.

      Reinforcement Learning (RL) tries to mimic human behaviour of ‘learning through experience.’ RL attempts to copy the process of learning strategies by interacting with environment. RL is exciting because it is possible to learn long-term strategies and apply them to complex industrial problems. This is due to the fact that Machine Learning is not intrinsively designed to solve sequential decision making, and RL attempts to solve this problem by learning to maximize optimal reward through trail and error.</p>
